After an OSX update I attempted to run `yarn serve` and was greeted with an unexpected error. 
```
error An unexpected error occurred: "Failed to replace env in config: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}".
```

That's super weird because I was running the same command a day earlier without incident. Now after a simple OS update yarn was blowing up.

If you can't tell from the error message I use the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to keep my home directory as clean as possible. I like a clean home directory but also using XDG gives me something to gripe about to other developers. So many devs ignore the specification and dump their dot files straight into my home directory. 

Trying to maintain XDG means constantly making sure that the right environment variables are set up. OSX updates have a tendency to reset everything. So that was my first thought of a problem origin. But, after double checking, all my environment variables were set up correctly. 

Time to do an internet search.

After some googling (in my case duckduckgoing) I found various stackoverflow posts talking about a similar error but with the env variable `${NPM_TOKEN}` which didn't match the environment variable I was seeing. I tried a few of the suggestions anyway but they didn't seem to help.

Finally, I came across a GitHub issue on the npm repo. The issue was pretty old and talking about issues with XDG and npm. [This comment](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6675#issuecomment-75163496) caught my eye. I figured what the heck and deleted the curly braces around the variables in my local npmrc (because of XDG this resides in `~/.config/npm/npmrc`). I saved the file and attempted to run yarn. 

It worked! 

I have no idea why that caused an issue and am hesitant to say that curly braces were the actual culprit but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
