After upgrading to PHP 8 on a server where I was running a [Slimframework V3](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/) application I started receiving this mysterious error.

The error was "Unknown named parameter $routes" occuring on line 39 of `Slim\Handlers\Strategines\RequestResponseArgs.php`. That line looks like this:
```php
return call_user_func_array($callable, $routeArguments);
```

I use `RequestResponseArgs` so that I can have named parameters in my route functions. It just makes things so much cleaner. Since I didn't write that class and it worked just fine in PHP 7.4 I immediately thought this was something that was changed in PHP 8. The problem was it wasn't immediately obvious what had occurred. In that line there is no variable named `$routes` and the `call_user_func_array` method didn't look like it was being used improperly. So what's the deal?

After some searching around I can across [this article](https://chrislloyd.co/fixing-laravel-php-8-error-unknown-named-parameter-error/) which was describing a similar problem in Laravel. It mentioned that there was a change in PHP 8 to the way `call_user_func_array` and similar methods work. [Here is the description of that change](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/named_params#call_user_func_and_friends). Basically it boils down to how `call_user_func_array` operates when given an associative array. Prior to PHP 8 keys would be ignored when passing an associative array in. Now, with named parameters, array keys matter on that associative array. So in our example we have an array with a key named "routes" but the function we're calling doesn't take a parameter named "routes" so PHP 8 throws an error. 

The fix to this is quite simple. Strip the keys from the associative array:
```php
return call_user_func_array($callable, array_keys($routeArguments));
```   

Slim framework 3 lets you use whatever route strategy class you'd like so I made a duplicate of `Slim\Handlers\Strategines\RequestResponseArgs.php` adding in the `array_keys` call and now PHP 8 is happy üëç
