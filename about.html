		<p>I'm what's known in the biz as a "Software Engineer". Which is just a fancy way of saying I Google how to code something and then code it.</p>
		<p>I absolutely love programming though, and I spend a heck of a lot of time doing it.</p>

<h2>Professional Me</h2>
<p>
I graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2007 with a degree in Computer Science.
</p>
<p>
After graduation I found work at Perot Systems, which was later purchased by Dell. While at 
Perot, I worked with the team that managed the <a href="http://www.trtn.com/">Triton Container International</a>
account. Our project was known as Trifleet, a J2EE application responsible for the management 
of shipping container leasing.
</p>
<p>
I stayed on at Perot for a little over two years after which I joined Evasiv LLC, a small web 
development start up in Lexington Kentucky. There I worked on several websites for clients 
such as <a href="http://www.fasigtipton.com/">Fasig Tipton</a> and the <a href="http://www.uky.edu">University of Kentucky</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after I came on, Evasiv joined NetMediaOne, a slightly larger web development firm 
in Lexington. As a part of NetMediaOne I worked on several other project while maintaining 
my previous Evasiv projects.
</p>
<p>
In January of 2012 NetMediaOne rebranded itself as <a href="http://www.ableengine.com/">Able Engine</a>. 
However I left shortly after to pursue my own interests in freelance web development and consulting.
</p>
<p>
Late in 2012 I moved to New York City to work with <a href="https://krossover.com">Krossover</a> on improving 
their video uploading and streaming capabilities with Amazon S3. As well as advising on development 
process improvements. I worked there for about 2.5 years before leaving to work on some freelance 
opportunities. 
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2015 I landed at <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a> on their payments team. Here my colleagues 
and I maintain the payment stack for the whole e-commerce site. Millions of transactions a day, nbd.

<h2>My Blog</h2>
<p>
This blog is more for me to record things that took a great amount of effort to learn. Any usefulness 
you derive from it is purely coincidence. 
</p>
<p>
That said, I appreciate you looking and wish you the best in your coding journeys.
